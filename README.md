  <p><i>Huemelody ‚Äî An interactive learning device that transforms colors into musical melodies</i></p>
</div>

## üåà Project Overview

Huemelody is a heptagonal interactive device that transforms colors into musical melodies, enhancing children's multi-sensory experience through color-to-music conversion. The device offers two interaction modes, allowing users to experience how colors from artworks, environments, and creative combinations can be converted into unique musical melodies using AI technology and color sensing.

Through hands-on interaction with Huemelody, users can explore the potential relationships between colors and sounds, fostering creativity, environmental awareness, and multi-sensory learning in children, providing enriching experiences in both individual and collaborative environments.

## ‚ú® Features and Benefits

- **Accommodates Diverse Interaction Preferences**: Offers two interaction methods - observation of structured art cards and exploration of environmental colors
- **Multi-sensory Experience**: Simultaneously stimulates visual, auditory, and tactile senses, naturally enhancing focus and engagement
- **Self-directed Exploratory Learning**: Encourages children to discover connections between visual and auditory elements through firsthand exploration
- **Color-to-Music Mapping**: Creates musical melodies based on HSV color characteristics (hue, saturation, brightness)
- **Integration of Art and Technology**: Combines art appreciation with music creation, promoting STEAM education

## üîß Technical Implementation

Huemelody creates a seamless color-to-sound experience by combining sensing technology with algorithmic composition:

1. **Color Sensing**: Utilizes TCS34725 RGB color sensor to capture color data
2. **Data Processing**: Performs normalization, color space conversion, and classification
3. **Musical Mapping**: Maps colors to musical elements based on the HSV model
   - **Hue**: Determines instruments and scale modes
   - **Saturation**: Influences rhythmic complexity and note density
   - **Value (Brightness)**: Controls pitch range and melodic contour

## üé® Interaction Modes

Huemelody offers two primary interaction modes (toggled by long-pressing the top knob):

### 1. Basic Detection Mode

Displays and plays sounds for individual colors, and provides special sound effects for color families based on children's associations (e.g., alarm sounds for reds, dolphin sounds for blues). These special effects are triggered when five different colors from the same color family are consecutively detected.

### 2. Art Learning Mode

Collects five key colors from artwork and automatically plays the unique musical melody of that artwork, enhancing the art appreciation experience.

## üí° Use Cases

Huemelody has been field-tested in different environments, creating engaging multi-sensory experiences:

- **Classroom Setting**: Children were fascinated by discovering what artworks "sound like," eagerly scanning Munch's paintings and competing to find the key colors that trigger the complete musical piece
- **Outdoor Setting**: The device transformed farm items into musical instruments, with children comparing the sounds of flowers, fruits, and natural materials

## üìê Physical Design

Huemelody adopts a heptagonal structure, symbolizing Newton's theory of seven primary colors. The device dimensions (46mm height, 68mm diameter) are suitable for single-handed operation by children, with a color sensor located at the bottom.

## üîå Hardware Configuration

- **Microcontroller**: ESP32 (supporting WiFi and Bluetooth connectivity)
- **Color Sensor**: TCS34725 RGB color sensor
- **LED Display**: 12 addressable RGB LEDs (WS2812B)
- **Audio Output**: I2S digital audio
- **User Input**: Rotary encoder (with button)
- **Storage**: MicroSD card (for storing audio files)
